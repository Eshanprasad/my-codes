string = "welcome to python programming"
words = string.split(' ')                    # splits the string according to space
words.reverse()
for i in words:
    print(i,"",end="")                       # output: programming python to welcome
    



# Approach 2
string = "welcome to python programming"
words = string.split(' ')
words = words[::-1]
output = " ".join(words)                      # joins elements in words separated by space between elements
print(output)                                 #  # output: programming python to welcome
